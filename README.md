### Problem

The  way courts operates in Nigeria encourages corruption, this led to the weak justice system that is currently obtainable and lack of faith in the judiciary by the public.

Case Files are constantly stolen/destroyed  by criminals and faux database hack claims are sometimes made by corrupt officials, which is not in tandem with sustainable development goal 16  


### Solution


The solution is STOLID, a decentralized file management and workspace for the judiciary. This would enable countries meet the SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 16 which is to ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements.

Stolid also enables clerks, registrars, judges and the chief justice perform their various functions without fear or interference. As it provides a secured trail of the various cases from inception till conclusion.



Some of the current features of STOLID:

#### THE PUBLIC

- Alchemy - Alchemy broadcasts the dapp
- IPFS - IPFS is used to store files
- Rops - The smart contracts are deployed to Ropsten testnet 
- Login with Unstoppable

### Deployments

The smart contract is deployed to Ropsten  Network
